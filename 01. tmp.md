As you can see, in the linuxstuff directory (and in all other directories), there are two special directories called (.) and (..)
The current directory (.)

In Linux, (.) means the current directory, so typing

$ cd .

NOTE: there is a space between cd and the dot

$ ls -la

means stay where you are (the linuxstuff directory).

This may not seem very useful at first, but using (.) as the name of the current directory will save a lot of typing, as we shall see later in the tutorial.
The parent directory (..)

(..) means the parent of the current directory, so typing

$ cd ..

will take you one directory up the hierarchy (back to your home directory). Try it now and then type

$ ls -l

Note: typing cd with no argument always returns you to your home directory. This is very useful if you are lost in the file system.
1.5 Pathnames

pwd (print working directory)

Pathnames enable you to work out where you are in relation to the whole file-system. For example, to find out the absolute pathname of your home-directory, type cd to get back to your home-directory and then type

$ pwd

The full pathname will look something like this -

/home/alumnos/cursof

which means that cursof (your home directory) is in the sub-directory alumnos,which is in the home sub-directory, which is in the top-level root directory called " / " .

Exercise

Type:

$ cd linuxstaff/backups/

which would be the path of the working directory?
1.6 More about home directories and pathnames
Understanding pathnames

First type cd to get back to your home-directory,

$ cd

then type

$ ls linuxstuff/

to list the contents of your linuxstuff directory.

Now type

$ ls backups/

You will get a message like this -

ls: no se puede acceder a backups/: No existe el archivo o el directorio

The reason is, backups is not in your current working directory. To use a command on a file (or directory) not in the current working directory (the directory you are currently in), you must either cd to the correct directory, or specify its full pathname. To list the contents of your backups directory, you must type (after created it)

$ ls linuxstuff/backups/
~ (your home directory)

Home directories can also be referred to by the tilde ~ character. It can be used to specify paths starting at your home directory. So typing

$ ls ~/linuxstuff

will list the contents of your linuxstuffdirectory, no matter where you currently are in the file system.

What do you think

$ ls ~

would list?

What do you think

$ ls ~/..

would list?
